            "Innovators at NASA\"s Glenn Research Center have developed a breakthrough in ion thruster technology. The Annular Ion <span class=\"highlight\">Engine</span> (AIE) features an annular discharge chamber with a set of annular ion optics, potentially configured with a centrally mounted neutralizer cathode assembly. Compared to current state-of-the-art, cylindrically shaped ion thrusters, the AIE includes two primary advantages: 1) it enables scaling of ion thruster technology to high power at specific impulse (Isp) desirable for near-term missions, and 2) it provides a substantial increase in both thrust density and thrust-to-power (F/P) ratio. With its additional increase in lifetime service and improvements in packaging, Glenn\"s AIE represents the next generation of electric propulsion systems that require higher power, F/P, and efficiency, such as Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) vehicles that may transport humans to the moon and Mars.",

The coil-on-plug configuration eliminates the bulky standalone coil-pack and conventional high-voltage spark plug cable by combining the coil and the spark plug into a single component.

The correlation is then performed using a Hamming similarity calculator function embedded in a one-bit digital correlator (OBDC). By converting the analog signal into a bit stream, the calculation of the correlation function is simplified, and fewer hardware resources are needed. This binary representation allows the hardware to move from a digital signal processor, where instructions are performed serially, into digital logic where calculations can be performed in parallel, greatly speeding up calculations.",

            "NASA has developed a new method of wing shaping using distributed propulsion that can revolutionize the design of aircraft. Distributed propulsion aeroelastic wing shaping is a new aircraft concept. Most commercial aircraft are still utilizing one gas-turbine <span class=\"highlight\">engine</span> per wing. By contrast, distributed propulsion envisions the use of multiple small electrically powered propulsion units distributed along the wings. By taking advantage of increased wing flexibility afforded by the use of light-weight materials such as composites, the aeroelastic deflection of a wing can be actively shaped in-flight for optimal aerodynamic efficiency by varying the amount of thrust generated by the propulsion units. By using distributed propulsion, the optimal wing shape can be used for other phases such as takeoff, landing, and in-flight maneuvers. In addition, distributed propulsion can be leveraged for yaw and roll controls, thus reducing the need for a full vertical tail size for weight savings. Thus, an entire aircraft design can be developed more creatively using distributed propulsion concepts for reduced fuel burn. Initial performance analysis indicates that this concept could achieve about 4% increase in lift-to-drag ratio.",

            "The two main sub-scale, ground-based rocket aerodynamics testing techniques  hot-fire testing and cold-flow testing  pose a series of tradeoffs. Hot-fire testing is generally much more accurate, but is often burdensome, costly, and requires long lead times due to design work, infrastructure preparation, etc. Cold-flow testing is much less expensive and has a rapid turnaround time, but conventional simulants (e.g., nitrogen, steam) used in cold-flow testing yield less accurate results (i.e., results that are not sufficiently representative of test article performance). \n\nWhile researching methods to optimize such tradeoffs, engineers at NASAs Stennis Space Center discovered that ethane can be tuned to approximate rocket exhaust plumes generated by several common rocket propellants. This led NASA to develop the HYdrocarbon Propellants Enabling Reproduction of Flows in Rocket Engines (HYPERFIRE), a sub-scale, non-reacting flow test system. HYPERFIRE uses heated ethane to enable physical simulation of rocket engines powered by a broad range of propellants in an inexpensive, accurate, and simple fashion.",

For the first time, it is possible to batch-fabricate ultra-thin SiC diaphragms that can sense very low pressures, enabling pressure sensors that can measure sub-psi pressures. This faster process makes it easier and less costly to produce complex, advanced semiconductors that are fully functional at temperatures greater than 600&deg;C.

NASA Glenn's innovation allows the operating frequency of a sensor instrument to be time variant because the sensor is part of the frequency generator\"s transfer function. Each instrument associated with a sensor imparts a unique (orthogonal) signature onto the continuous output of that sensor. As a consequence, the outputs of numerous instruments may be simultaneously superimposed upon one another via a linear combining medium and then be separated at a common receiving node in a more temperate location using any number of linear source separation techniques. A listening node, using various techniques, can pick out the signal from a single sender, if it has unique qualities; e.g., a 'voice.' This technique is analogous to the human brain recognizing and following a single conversation in a party full of people talking and other distracting noises.",

Additive manufacturing is used to make this unique structure. Prototypes have demonstrated a 50% reduction in resonant vibration. Importantly, the innovation also enables improved predictive modelling of the resonant behavior of new blisk designs because the tuned-mass absorber acts as a linear system.

The paraffin based fuel survives in low temperatures (-100 C), freeing up energy for other vehicle or mission purposes.  Challenges arose with manufacturing these fuel grains due to the &#126;15&#37;  volume liquid to solid phase change, different density ingredients and inherent brittle nature of paraffin wax.

Simple-hinged flaps are less complex, and an ideal choice for low-drag cruise efficiency. However, simple-hinged flaps require high flap deflections to achieve lift comparable to Fowler flaps. These flap deflections cause severe  adverse pressure gradients, which generate flow separation that is difficult to control.\n\nIn response to these challenges, NASA developed the High Efficiency Low Power (HELP) active flow control (AFC) system. This simple, elegant invention can control flow separation resulting from the high flap deflections required by simple-hinged flap systems – making such flaps a viable option for aircraft designers.
